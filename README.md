# CSC578A: Hitman Minimap Crowd Simulation

This repo will eventually contain the semester project for CSC578A where I intend to emulate specific functions of hitman crowds (especially from the earlier games) onto a 2D grid, which would traaditionally be considered as the minimap of the hitman world.
